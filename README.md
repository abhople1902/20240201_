<h2>Firefly in a jar</h2>
<br>
<body>
  The code generates a random number in its first iteration to decide the placement of a firefly (asterisk).
  In the further iterations, two random numbers in the range of [-1,0,1] (integral) are generated to determine the change in the asterisk's position.
  It gives out an effect of a firefly moving randomly in a box. The function calls itself in intervals and the console is cleared every interval.
